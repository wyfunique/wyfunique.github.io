My solutions to some Leetcode problems ranging in #201-250.

### 205. Isomorphic Strings

**Description:**

Given two strings **s** and **t**, determine if they are isomorphic.

Two strings are isomorphic if the characters in **s** can be replaced to get **t**.

All occurrences of a character must be replaced with another character while preserving the order of characters. No two characters may map to the same character but a character may map to itself.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = "egg", t = "add"
Output: true
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = "foo", t = "bar"
Output: false
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: s = "paper", t = "title"
Output: true
```

**Note:**
You may assume both **s** and **t** have the same length.

**Solution:**

Maintain a dictionary to check if there are two same chars in one string corresponding to different chars in another string.

**Code:**

```python
class Solution(object):
    def isIsomorphic(self, s, t):
        """
        :type s: str
        :type t: str
        :rtype: bool
        """
        def helper(s, t):
            char_map = {}
            for i in range(len(s)):
                if s[i] not in char_map:
                    char_map[s[i]] = t[i]
                else:
                    if char_map[s[i]] != t[i]:
                        return False
            return True
        
        return helper(s, t) and helper(t, s) # s=aa, t=ab or s=ab, t=aa are neither isomorphic.
```

**Note:**

The helper function only checks the case that two same chars in s corresponding to different chars in t (like s="aa" and t="ab"). So we have to do it again for another case that maps from t to s (like s="ab" and t="aa").



### 206.Â Reverse Linked List

**Description:**

Reverse a singly linked list.

**Example:**

```
Input: 1->2->3->4->5->NULL
Output: 5->4->3->2->1->NULL
```

**Follow up:**

A linked list can be reversed either iteratively or recursively. Could you implement both?

**Solution:**

The main idea is to maintain 3 variables that record previous, current, and next nodes. Then we only need to make "current.next = previous" and move them by one node. Repeat this process until they move to the tail.

In iterative way, this is done using 3 pointers, while in recursive way, this is done by passing them as parameters.

**Code:**

```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode(object):
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.next = None

class Solution(object):
    def reverseList(self, head):
        """
        :type head: ListNode
        :rtype: ListNode
        """
        
        # Iterative way -- 24 ms
        if not head or not head.next:
            return head
        
        prev = head
        cur = head.next
        _next = cur.next
        head.next = None
        while _next:
            cur.next = prev
            prev = cur
            cur = _next
            _next = _next.next
        cur.next = prev
        return cur
        
        '''
        # Recursive way -- 32 ms
        def helper(head, prev):
            if not head.next:
                head.next = prev
                return head # return the last node before reversing, which is the first node after reversing
            _next = head.next
            head.next = prev
            return helper(_next, head)
        
        if not head:
            return None
        return helper(head, None)
        '''
        
        
```
