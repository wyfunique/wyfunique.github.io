In this survey, we first provide an overview of the "similarity query" and "similarity query processing" problems. Then we talk about recent approaches on designing the indexes and operators for highly efficient similarity query processing on top of embeddings (or more generally, high dimensional data). Finally, we investigate the specific solutions with and without using embeddings in selected application domains of similarity queries, including entity resolution and information retrieval. By comparing the solutions, we show how neural embeddings benefit those applications. [PDF](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.07922)
